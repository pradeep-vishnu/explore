explore
===========
Simple DIY scripts that I have used for exploring various Âµc's and MEM's sensors. 

1. GT511C3_fingerprint_scanner.ino  : An example Arduino project for exploring the GT511C3 fingerprint scanner. This sketch can be used for enrolling and detecting                                       the fingerprints into and from the database of the sensor. 
2. MPU9250_imu.py : A python library example for obtaining the raw data from MPU9250 using FaBo9Axis_MPU9250 package.
